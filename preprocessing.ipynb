       "'2002). Nash was the subject of the 2001 movie A Beautiful Mind. Why did these people have these\\nexperiences? How does the human brain work? And what is the connection between the brain’s internal\\nprocesses and people’s external behaviors? This textbook will introduce you to various ways that the field of\\npsychology has explored these questions.\\n1.1 What Is Psychology?\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to:\\n• Define psychology\\n• Understand the merits of an education in psychology\\nWhat is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology\\nexplores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists\\nuse the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question\\nabout how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the\\nphenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or\\ngroup of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over\\ntime. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes\\nobservations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then\\npublished or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results.\\nScientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because\\nit is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We\\nmust ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However,\\nwe can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus,\\npsychological science is empirical, based on measurable data.\\nIn general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot\\narrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the\\nmind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific\\nmethod is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on\\nobservation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or\\nprevious authorities.\\nIt was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline. Before this\\ntime, the workings of the mind were considered under the auspices of philosophy. Given that any behavior is,\\nat its roots, biological, some areas of psychology take on aspects of a natural science like biology. No biological\\norganism exists in isolation, and our behavior is influenced by our interactions with others. Therefore,\\npsychology is also a social science.\\nWHY STUDY PSYCHOLOGY?\\nOften, students take their first psychology course because they are interested in helping others and want to\\nlearn more about themselves and why they act the way they do. Sometimes, students take a psychology course\\nbecause it either satisfies a general education requirement or is required for a program of study such as\\nnursing or pre-med. Many of these students develop such an interest in the area that they go on to declare\\npsychology as their major. As a result, psychology is one of the most popular majors on college campuses\\nacross the United States (Johnson & Lubin, 2011). A number of well-known individuals were psychology\\nmajors. Just a few famous names on this list are Facebook’s creator Mark Zuckerberg, television personality\\nand political satirist Jon Stewart, actress Natalie Portman, and filmmaker Wes Craven (Halonen, 2011). About\\n6 percent of all bachelor degrees granted in the United States are in the discipline of psychology (U.S.\\nDepartment of Education, 2016).\\n8 1 • Introduction to Psychology\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'"

       "'2.4 Ethics\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\nBy the end of this section, you will be able to: • Discuss how research involving human subjects is regulated • Summarize the processes of informed consent and debriefing • Explain how research involving animal subjects is regulated\\nToday, scientists agree that good research is ethical in nature and is guided by a basic respect for human dignity and safety. However, as you will read in the feature box, this has not always been the case. Modern researchers must demonstrate that the research they perform is ethically sound. This section presents how ethical considerations affect the design and implementation of research conducted today.\\nResearch Involving Human Participants\\nAny experiment involving the participation of human subjects is governed by extensive, strict guidelines designed to ensure that the experiment does not result in harm. Any research institution that receives federal support for research involving human participants must have access to an institutional review board (IRB).\\nThe IRB is a committee of individuals often made up of members of the institution’s administration, scientists, and community members (Figure 2.20). The purpose of the IRB is to review proposals for research that involves human participants. The IRB reviews these proposals with the principles mentioned above in mind, and generally, approval from the IRB is required in order for the experiment to proceed.\\nEVERYDAY CONNECTION 2.4 • Ethics 59\\nFIGURE 2.20 An institution’s IRB meets regularly to review experimental proposals that involve human participants. (credit: International Hydropower Association/Flickr)\\nAn institution’s IRB requires several components in any experiment it approves. For one, each participant must sign an informed consent form before they can participate in the experiment. An informed consent form provides a written description of what participants can expect during the experiment, including potential risks and implications of the research. It also lets participants know that their involvement is completely voluntary and can be discontinued without penalty at any time. Furthermore, the informed consent guarantees that any data collected in the experiment will remain completely confidential. In cases where research participants are under the age of 18, the parents or legal guardians are required to sign the informed consent form.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nView this example of a consent form (http://openstax.org/l/consentform) to learn more.\\nWhile the informed consent form should be as honest as possible in describing exactly what participants will be doing, sometimes deception is necessary to prevent participants’ knowledge of the exact research question from affecting the results of the study. Deception involves purposely misleading experiment participants in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment, but not to the point where the deception could be considered harmful. For example, if we are interested in how our opinion of someone is affected by their attire, we might use deception in describing the experiment to prevent that knowledge from affecting participants’ responses.\\nIn cases where deception is involved, participants must receive a full debriefing upon conclusion of the study—complete, honest information about the purpose of the experiment, how the data collected will be used, the reasons why deception was necessary, and information about how to obtain additional information about the study.\\nEthics and the Tuskegee Syphilis Study\\nUnfortunately, the ethical guidelines that exist for research today were not always applied in the past. In 1932, rural, Black men from Tuskegee, Alabama, were recruited to participate in an experiment conducted by the U.S.\\nPublic Health Service, with the aim of studying syphilis in Black men (Figure 2.21). In exchange for free medical care, meals, and burial insurance, 600 men agreed to participate in the study. A little more than half of the men tested positive for syphilis, and they served as the experimental group (given that the researchers could not randomly assign participants to groups, this represents a quasi-experiment). The remaining syphilis-free\\nDIG DEEPER 60 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org\\nindividuals served as the control group. However, those individuals that tested positive for syphilis were never informed that they had the disease.\\nWhile there was no treatment for syphilis when the study began, by 1947 penicillin was recognized as an effective treatment for the disease. Despite this, no penicillin was administered to the participants in this study, and the participants were not allowed to seek treatment at any other facilities if they continued in the study. Over the course of 40 years, many of the participants unknowingly spread syphilis to their wives (and subsequently their children born from their wives) and eventually died because they never received treatment for the disease.\\nThis study was discontinued in 1972 when the experiment was discovered by the national press (Tuskegee\\nUniversity, n.d.). The resulting outrage over the experiment led directly to the National Research Act of 1974 and the strict ethical guidelines for research on humans described in this chapter. Why is this study unethical? How were the men who participated and their families harmed as a function of this research?\\nFIGURE 2.21 A participant in the Tuskegee Syphilis Study receives an injection.\\nLINK T O LEARNING\\nVisit this website about the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (http://openstax.org/l/tuskegee) to learn more.\\nResearch Involving Animal Subjects\\nMany psychologists conduct research involving animal subjects. Often, these researchers use rodents (Figure 2.22) or birds as the subjects of their experiments—the APA estimates that 90% of all animal research in psychology uses these species (American Psychological Association, n.d.). Because many basic processes in animals are sufficiently similar to those in humans, these animals are acceptable substitutes for research that would be considered unethical in human participants.\\nFIGURE 2.22 Rats, like the one shown here, often serve as the subjects of animal research.\\nThis does not mean that animal researchers are immune to ethical concerns. Indeed, the humane and ethical 2.4 • Ethics 61\\ntreatment of animal research subjects is a critical aspect of this type of research. Researchers must design their experiments to minimize any pain or distress experienced by animals serving as research subjects.\\nWhereas IRBs review research proposals that involve human participants, animal experimental proposals are reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). An IACUC consists of institutional administrators, scientists, veterinarians, and community members. This committee is charged with ensuring that all experimental proposals require the humane treatment of animal research subjects. It also conducts semi-annual inspections of all animal facilities to ensure that the research protocols are being followed. No animal research project can proceed without the committee’s approval.\\n62 2 • Psychological Research\\nAccess for free at openstax.org'"

      "1.1 What Is Psychology? LEARNING OBJECTIVES By the end of this section, you will be able to: • Define psychology • Understand the merits of an education in psychology What is creativity? What are prejudice and discrimination? What is consciousness? The field of psychology explores questions like these. Psychology refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists use the scientific method to acquire knowledge. To apply the scientific method, a researcher with a question about how or why something happens will propose a tentative explanation, called a hypothesis, to explain the phenomenon. A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world.\n",

      "A hypothesis should fit into the context of a scientific theory, which is a broad explanation or group of explanations for some aspect of the natural world that is consistently supported by evidence over time. A theory is the best understanding we have of that part of the natural world. The researcher then makes observations or carries out an experiment to test the validity of the hypothesis. Those results are then published or presented at research conferences so that others can replicate or build on the results. Scientists test that which is perceivable and measurable. For example, the hypothesis that a bird sings because it is happy is not a hypothesis that can be tested since we have no way to measure the happiness of a bird. We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us.\n",

      "We must ask a different question, perhaps about the brain state of the bird, since this can be measured. However, we can ask individuals about whether they sing because they are happy since they are able to tell us. Thus, psychological science is empirical, based on measurable data. In general, science deals only with matter and energy, that is, those things that can be measured, and it cannot arrive at knowledge about values and morality. This is one reason why our scientific understanding of the mind is so limited, since thoughts, at least as we experience them, are neither matter nor energy. The scientific method is also a form of empiricism. An empirical method for acquiring knowledge is one based on observation, including experimentation, rather than a method based only on forms of logical argument or previous authorities. It was not until the late 1800s that psychology became accepted as its own academic discipline.\n",

They objected to the pessimism and determinism (all actions driven by the unconscious) of Freud. They also disliked the reductionism, or simplifying nature, of behaviorism. Behaviorism is also deterministic at its core, because it sees human behavior as entirely determined by a combination of genetics and environment. Some psychologists began to form their own ideas that emphasized personal control, intentionality, and a true predisposition for “good” as important for our self-concept and our behavior. Thus, humanism emerged. Humanism is a perspective within psychology that emphasizes the potential for good that is innate to all humans. Two of the most well-known proponents of humanistic psychology are Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers (O’Hara, n.d.).'"
